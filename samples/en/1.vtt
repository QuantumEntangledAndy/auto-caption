00:10:19.587 --> 00:10:20.397
we did one

257
00:10:20.457 --> 00:10:21.177

00:10:49.707 --> 00:10:50.37
these guys

275
00:10:50.37 --> 00:10:50.847

i was going to drive you into the middle of the galaxy and shove you into the vacuum of space with your dick hanging out

284
00:11:13.527 --> 00:11:14.877

you have no frame of reference

295
00:11:28.917 --> 00:11:30.27
