68
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.30

275
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:49.620

you have no frame of reference

295
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.610

morty

378
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.470
two squirrels morty

379
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:16.50
we got a good five minutes before they're back and up one morning with a pack up and move your reality marty

380
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.800

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.480
i'm familiar with the bubble morty

387
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:37.980
i also dabble in precision and if you think you can even approach it with your sad naked caveman eyeball in a bubble of air

388
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.830
you're the reason this species is a failure and it makes me angry

389
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.520
you're drunk

390
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.480

392
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.140
rupee land wasn't my best work

393
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.440
i don't know does it deserve to be on creatively yeah

394
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:49.950
that's right

395
00:15:50.70 --> 00:15:52.50
i agree with your look of horrified realization

396
00:15:52.110 --> 00:16:01.800
you can be very inconsiderate sometimes so you're mining stuff to craft with crafting stuff to mine with how did your dad right this games we should talk to him yeah that sounds fun

397
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.320
let's set some boundaries with a spoiled control freak

398
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.810
that thinks he runs the world and order drone strikes to cope

399
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:07.740
with this insecurity

400
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.630
it's either that or more this

401
00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.240
i think a lot of my own
